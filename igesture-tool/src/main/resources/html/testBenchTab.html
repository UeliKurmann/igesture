<h1>iGesture Test Bench</h1>
The iGesture Test Bench is a tool to manually configure and test
algorithms with gesture sets available in the currently opened project.
<br />
<br />
In the tree structure on the left-hand side, all the registered and available
<b>algorithms</b> are listed. A <b>configuration</b> can be added to an algorithm by using the
context menu on the algorithm level.
<br />
<br />
In the <b>configuration</b> panel the different parameters of the current
algorithm configuration can be set. At the bottom of the configuration
panel there is the <b>input area</b> for the actual tests. For the recognition
to work correctly, a gesture set first has to be chosen from the
drop-down menu between the two rectangular boxes. A gesture can then be
drawn in the left box. After pressing the <b>recognise</b> button, the
gesture input will be processed and the result of the recognition will
be shown in the box on the right.
