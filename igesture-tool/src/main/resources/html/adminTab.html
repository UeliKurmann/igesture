<h1>iGesture Data Structure</h1>
The figure below shows the simplified core data structure of iGesture. A
<b>gesture class</b> describes a gesture in an abstract manner. Multiple
gesture classes are taken together into <b>gesture sets</b>. Therefore, a
gesture set is a number of related gestures which are used by an
application.
<br />
<br />
The <b>gesture descriptor</b> is a concrete description of the gestures. A
gesture class should has at least one descriptor. The most used
descriptor is the SampleDescriptor. It is used for training based
algorithms (e.g. Rubine Algorithm) and is composed of a number of
samples.

The left side of the figure shows the abstract data structure. On the right
side a concrete example of a gesture set and its gesture classes and
descriptions is imaged.
