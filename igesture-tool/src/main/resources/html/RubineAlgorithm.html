The Rubine algorithm was developed in 1991 and represented one
of the first algorithms published for the recognition of mouse and pen-based gestures. An
important feature of this algorithm is that gestures are not described programmatically but
learnt by examples. With the appropriate tools, such as the management console of iGesture,
it becomes a simple and quick task to create new gestures and add them to the gesture
recognition engine.
<p>
Features are extracted from the gestures consisting of time stamped points and used in the
recognition process. The classification itself does not depend on specific features which
allows us to use it for different recognition tasks as long as it is possible to describe the
classifiable objects by feature vectors.<p>
