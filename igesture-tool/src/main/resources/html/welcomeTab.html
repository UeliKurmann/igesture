While there exists a variety of gesture recognition frameworks, none of them addresses the issues of supporting both application developers as well as the designers of new recognition algorithms. iGesture supports the application developer who would like to add new gesture recognition functionality to their application as well as the designer of new gesture recognition algorithms. The iGesture framework can easily be configured to use any of the existing recognition algorithms (e.g. Rubine, SiGeR) or customised gesture sets can be defined. Furthermore, the Test Bench provides tools to test new gesture recognition algorithms and to evaluate their performance.
