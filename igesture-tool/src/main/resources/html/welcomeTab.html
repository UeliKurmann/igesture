While there exists a variety of gesture recognition frameworks, none of
them addresses the issues of supporting both application developers as
well as the designers of new gesture recognition algorithms. iGesture supports
the application developer who would like to add new gesture recognition
functionality to their application as well as the designer of new
gesture recognition algorithms. The iGesture framework can easily be
configured to use any of the existing recognition algorithms (e.g.
Rubine, SiGeR) or new gesture recognition algorithms can be added. The
iGesture framework provides some predefined gesture sets but
customised gesture sets can be defined based on the iGesture Workbench. The Test
Bench, a specific component of the iGesture Workbench, provides tools to test
new gesture recognition algorithms and to evaluate their performance.

<h1>How to use the iGesture Workbench</h1>
<h2>Open a Project</h2>
The iGesture Workbench stores all data of a working session in a specific project.
To start working with the iGesture Workbench you have to
create a new or open an existing project by using the File ->
Open Project... menu. To create a new iGesture project just enter a new file name in the
browse dialogue. The preferred file format is *.igz. 
<h2>Features</h2>
The iGesture Workbench contains the following components:
<ul>
<li>A tool to manage gesture sets</li>
<li>A tool to manage test sets</li>
<li>A Testbench to capture and recognise gestures</li>
<li>A tool to find optimal algorithm configurations</li>
</ul>
