			<p>
				The usual computer mouse can be used as input device.
				Gestures are captured while pressing the middle mouse
				button. The input device is selected in the config.xml
				file located in the root directory of the distribution.
			</p>
			<p>
				Unfortunately, the support of the computer mouse is
				limited to the Microsoft Windows operation system.

				capture the mouse position.
