			<p>
				The usual computer mouse can be used as input device.
				Gestures are captured while pressing the left mouse
				button.
			</p>
			<p>
				Unfortunately, the support of the computer mouse is
				limited to the Microsoft Windows operation system.
				<a

					NativeCall
				</a>
				 is used to access the Windows System libraries to
				capture the mouse position.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that if the <i>SwingMouseReader</i> is used, the other
				operating system are supported if the gesture is performed 
				on a Swing canvas element.
