			<p>
				The Signature algorithm was designed as part of a diploma thesis. The idea behind this algorithm is to approximate gestures 
				with a signature whereas the signature is computed from example gestures as done in the Rubine algorithm. The signatures are 
				compared based on distance functions leading to a classification.
			</p>
			<p>
				For the creation of the signature we use a grid which consists of squares of the same size. Each square is identified with a bit 
				string and two neighbouring squares always differ in exactly one bit.
			</p>
			<p>
				During the preprocessing phase the gestures are stretched to a uniform size and mapped onto the grid. Each point of the gesture can 
				now be represented with the bit string of its related square as shown in Figure 4.2. The full signature consists of the 
				concatenation of these bit strings.
