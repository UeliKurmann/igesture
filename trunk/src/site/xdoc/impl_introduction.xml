			iGesture is developed on the
			<a href="http://java.sun.com">Java 1.6</a>
			platform and is based on
			<a href="http://www.sigtec.org">sigtec</a>
			and
			<a href="http://www.xima.org">iPaper</a>
			. sigtec is a library of common tool classes and is used for
			the ink representation and the XML functionality whereas
			iPaper provides access to Anoto-based input devices. Other
			libraries as the
			<i>Apache Jakarta Commons</i>
			are used. Note that we paid attention to use only
			third-party libraries which are available on the basis of an
			open source license.
			<p>
				The iGesture framework consists of different partially
				independent components. Roughly there is the recogniser,
				a management console and tools for testing and
				optimising algorithms as shown in Figure
				<a href="#fig%3Aimp_overview">1</a>
				. In addition to these components there exist common
				data structures and model classes that are used by all
				parts.
