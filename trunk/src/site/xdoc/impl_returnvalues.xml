			The result returned by the recogniser is structured into a
			result set which contains a list of results as shown in the
			class diagram in Figure
			<a href="#fig%3AResultSetUML">4</a>
			. We decided to return a set of possible results instead of
			a single one to delegate the selection of specific results
			to the application making use of the recogniser. The
			advantage of this approach is that the application may
			choose a result based on additional contextual information
			about the captured gesture.

			</p>
			<p>
				The result set also contains a reference to the original
				note which was used in the gesture recognition process.
				This would not be necessary for the direct use of the
				gesture set returned to the application but enables
				events working on the note. Otherwise they would not be
				aware of this information.
			</p>
			<p>
				The list of returned results is always ordered by the
				accuracy of the result or is empty if the recognition
				was unsuccessful. To simplify the access to the most
				likely result a convenience method is provided which
				directly returns the first result.
