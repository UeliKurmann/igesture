      <question>What is iGesture?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          iGesture is a Java-based gesture recognition framework focusing on extensibility 
          and cross-application reusability by providing an integrated solution that includes 
          the iGesture recognition framework as well as the iGesture tool component for the 
          creation of customised gesture sets.

      <question>How much do I have to pay for iGesture</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
		  You have to pay nothing for using iGesture which has been released under an Apache 2.0 license.
		  However, if you should write a publication about your project that makes use of iGesture we would appreciate
		  a reference to one of our <a href="publications.html">iGesture publications</a>. Furthermore, we are
		  always happy to hear from projects using iGesture and to get your feedback. Note that we plan to
		  add information about projects making use of iGesture to our website and therefore would like to hear
		  more about your project.

    <faq id="whatdownload">
      <question>Which file should I download?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          We provide different builds of iGesture hosted on SourceForge. If you are an iGesture newcomer we 
          recommend to download the prepared Eclipse Project (<a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/igesture/igesture_1.1-eclipse-project.zip">igesture_1.1-eclipse-project.zip</a>). It is preconfigured and contains all 
          necessary third-party libraries as well as the sources of the framework, the tool, gesture sets
          and some demo applications. All demo applications should be runnable out of the box. Please use
          the download link on the left hand side to get the files from SourceForge. We always recommend to use 
          the most recent version.
        </p>
        <p>
          For advanced users we recommend to use the sources available in the SVN repository hosted
          at Sourceforge. The sources and libraries are organised in a Maven project. Information 
          about the SVN repository is available <a href="source-repository.html">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Demo gesture sets are also available at SourceForge in the iGesture 1.0 release 
          (<a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/igesture/igesture-1.0-sample-data.zip">igesture-1.0-sample-data.zip</a>).
