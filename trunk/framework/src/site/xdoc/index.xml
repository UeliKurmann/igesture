			<p>
				Gestures have high potential to be used in paper and
				pen-based user interfaces. However, so far there exists
				no framework that on the one hand is powerful enough to
				satisfy the requirements of recent applications and on
				the other hand is easy to integrate. We provide an
				overview of existing approaches and present iGesture,
				our new solution to solve this problem. iGesture is a
				Java-based extensible framework and a set of related
				tools for gesture recognition, the creation and
				management of gestures as well as the evaluation of
				recognition algorithms. As part of the project, we
				described and implemented two existing and a new
				algorithm. The existing algorithms were extended to
				improve their recognition quality. All algorithms have
				been tested with different kind of gesture sets and
				users proving that our framework is sound. Finally, high
				recognition rates are achieved using our improved
				algorithms.
