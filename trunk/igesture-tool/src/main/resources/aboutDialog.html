<p>While there exists a variety of gesture recognition frameworks,
none of them addresses the issues of supporting both application
developers as well as the designers of new recognition algorithms.
iGesture supports the application developer who would like to add new
gesture recognition functionality to their application as well as the
designer of new gesture recognition algorithms. The iGesture framework
can easily be configured to use any of the existing recognition
algorithms (e.g. Rubine, SiGeR) or customised gesture sets can be
defined. Furthermore, the Test Bench provides tools to test new gesture
recognition algorithms and to evaluate their performance.</p>
<p>iGesture is a Java-based gesture recognition framework focusing
on extensibility and cross-application reusability by providing an
integrated solution that includes the iGesture recognition framework as
well as the iGesture Tool component for the creation of specific gesture
sets. The iGesture tool further enables the evaluation and optimisation
of new or existing gesture recognition algorithms.</p>
<p>The iGesture Framework is not restricted to a specific input
device. In addition to traditional screen and mouse-based interaction,
iGesture provides functionality for handling digital pen and paper
input.</p>
