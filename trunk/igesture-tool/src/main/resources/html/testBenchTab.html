<h1>iGesture Test Bench</h1>
The iGesture Test Bench is a tool to manually configure and test
algorithms with gesture sets managed in the active project.
<br />
<br />
In the tree structure on the left side the registered, available
algorithms are listed. Configurations can be attached to the algorithms
using the context menu on the algorithm level.
<br />
<br />
In the configuration panel the different parameters of the current
algorithm configuration can be set. On the bottom of this panel is the
actual Test Bench. On the left side, a gesture can be drawn. For the
recognition a gesture set has to be selected. With the "recognise"
button, the drawn gesture can be recognised and the result is displayed
on the right side.
