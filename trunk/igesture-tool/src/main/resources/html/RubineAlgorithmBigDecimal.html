The Rubine algorithm was developed in 1991 and represented one
of the first published algorithms for the recognition of mouse and pen-based gestures. An
important feature of this algorithm is that gestures are not described programmatically but
"learnt" by examples. With the appropriate tools, such as the <b>Gesture Set Manager</b> of
the iGesture Workbench, it becomes a simple and quick task to create new gesture classes
and add them to the gesture recognition engine.
<p>
Features are extracted from the gestures consisting of time stamped points and used in the
recognition process. The classification itself does not depend on specific features which
allows us to use it for different recognition tasks as long as it is possible to describe the
classifiable objects by feature vectors.
<p>
This implementation of the Rubine algorithm uses Big Decimals instead of doubles.
