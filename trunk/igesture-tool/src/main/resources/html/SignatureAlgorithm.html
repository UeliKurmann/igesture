The Signature algorithm was designed as part of this diploma thesis. The idea behind this
algorithm is to approximate gestures with a signature whereas the signature is computed
from example gestures as done in the Rubine algorithm. The signatures are compared based
on distance functions leading to a classification.
<p>
For the creation of the signature we use a grid which consists of squares of the same size.
Each square is identified with a bit string and two neighbouring squares always differ in
exactly one bit.
<p>
During the preprocessing phase the gestures are stretched to a uniform size and mapped onto
the grid. Each point of the gesture can now be represented with the bit string of its related
square as shown in Figure 4.2. The full signature consists of the concatenation of these bit
strings.
