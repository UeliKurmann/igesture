The SiGeR (Simple Gesture Recogniser) algorithm was developed by Scott Swigart for the
Microsoft Developer Network to illustrate the implementation of custom gesture recognisers
for the Microsoft Tablet PC platform. The algorithm classifies gestures on the basis of regular
expressions.
<p>
Gestures are described with the eight cardinal points (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W and
NW) and some statistical information. Out of this description a regular expression is created.
These regular expressions are applied to input gestures and if a class description matches the
input string, the gesture class is recognised as result. Therefore the classification is binary
and it is not possible to rate different results.
<p>
For example the gesture shown in Figure 4.1, starting at the red dot, can be described with
the following character string: E, N, W, S. Out of these characters the regular expression
(E)+(N)+(W)+(S)+ can be created. Because hand drawn lines may not be always
straight, the author proposed a more general form of the regular expression which also accepts
neighbouring distances. So the extended regular expression for this example gesture
would be (NE|E|SE)+(NW|N|NE)+(SW|W|NW)+(SE|S|SW)+.
