While there exists a variety of gesture recognition frameworks, none of
them addresses the issues of supporting both application developers as
well as the designers of new recognition algorithms. iGesture supports
the application developer who would like to add new gesture recognition
functionality to their application as well as the designer of new
gesture recognition algorithms. The iGesture framework can easily be
configured to use any of the existing recognition algorithms (e.g.
Rubine, SiGeR) or customised gesture sets can be defined. Furthermore,
the Test Bench provides tools to test new gesture recognition algorithms
and to evaluate their performance.

<h1>How to use iGesture Tool</h1>
<h2>Open a Workspace</h2>
iGesture Tool uses a workspace where all data of a working
session is stored. To start working with iGesture Tool you have to
create or open an existing workspace. Both is done using the File ->
Browse menu. To create a new workspace just enter a new file name in the
browse dialog. The preferred file format is *.igz. 
<h2>Features</h2>
iGesture Tool contains the following modules:
<ul>
<li>A Testbench to capture and recognise gestures</li>
<li>A tool to manage gesture sets</li>
<li>A tool to manage test sets</li>
<li>A tool to find optimised algorithm configurations</li>
</ul>
